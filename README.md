# A collection of awesome machine learning projects:

##### Feature engineering:
- [Featuretools](https://github.com/FeatureLabs/featuretools) Featuretools is a python library for automated feature engineering.

##### Machine learning models:
- [FBProphet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.
- [XGBoost](https://xgboost.ai/) Scalable and Flexible Gradient Boosting.

##### Model explanation:
- [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions.
- [LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) This project is about explaining what machine learning classifiers (or models) are doing.

##### Inference
- [Causal Impact](https://github.com/dafiti/causalimpact) An approach by google to estimating the causal effect of a designed intervention on a time series. For example, how many additional daily clicks were generated by an advertising campaign?

##### Workflow and deployment:
- [MLFlow](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html) MLflow is an open source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.

##### Coding:
- [Awesome scalability](https://github.com/binhnguyennus/awesome-scalability) An updated and organized reading list for illustrating the patterns of scalable, reliable, and performant large-scale systems.

#### Random:
- [Quant finance](https://github.com/wilsonfreitas/awesome-quant)
